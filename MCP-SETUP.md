# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Setup for Claude

This project is configured with MCP servers to enable Claude to interact with your browser and filesystem directly.

## Configuration

The MCP configuration is located in `.claude/claude.json` and includes:

### 1. Playwright Server
- **Purpose**: Browser automation, screenshots, web testing
- **Server**: `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`
- **Default URL**: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Filesystem Server  
- **Purpose**: File access and manipulation
- **Server**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- **Access**: Current project directory

## How to Enable MCP in Claude

1. **Start your dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the MCP configuration

3. **Verify MCP is loaded**:
   - Look for the MCP icon (ðŸ”Œ) in the bottom-right of Claude's input box
   - Click it to see available tools

## Available MCP Commands

Once MCP is loaded, Claude can:

### Browser Automation (Playwright)
- `navigate_to`: Open a URL in browser
